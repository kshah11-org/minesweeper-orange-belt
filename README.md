A board with squares is given

Some squares have mines
Some squares have numbers

Each square has neighbors
Any square directly - above - below - left - right - on the 4 diagonal
of a square is its neighbor

The number on the square will be the number of neighbors the square has that are not mines

If you hit a square with a mine, you lose
If you clear the board without hitting a mine, you win
